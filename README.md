# AlwaysTooLate.PlayMode

AlwaysTooLate PlayMode module, provides fast and easy to use main-scene startup under shortcut CTRL+Q!

# Installation

Open your target project in Unity and use the Unity Package Manager (`Window` -> `Package Manager` -> `+` -> `Add package from git URL`) and paste the following URL:
https://github.com/AlwaysTooLate/AlwaysTooLate.PlayMode.git

# How to use

After installation, just press **CTRL + Q** and the Unity Editor will automatically enter the playmode using your main scene (with build index = 0) from the `Build Settings`.
You can additionally overwrite the default Play button functionality by toggling `Tools/Always Too Late/PlayMode/Overwrite default playmode`, so it also can run the main scene.
